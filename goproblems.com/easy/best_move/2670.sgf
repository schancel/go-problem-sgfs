C[RIGHT Black gets a solid corner but 
White gets a nice position on the 
outside.

(There's still a mayor gap at n16 to 
aim at for Black so White's position is 
not that impressive.)]

C[RIGHT Black gets a solid corner but 
White gets a nice position on the 
outside.

(Although White is stronger than before 
Black has more territory and he still 
has the cut at m16 to aim at. If White 
want to keep the center influence intact 
after the cut, he should continue by 
pushing along the 5th line giving black 
a very nice 3rd line territory.)]

C[White gets too much influence this 
way.

(Black gains a little territory compared 
to the 1st variation but there are hardly 
any weaknesses left in the White 
position. Therefore this is not good.)]

Black 5 can be considered to be a little
